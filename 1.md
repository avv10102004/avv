Assignment 1: Git and GitHub Commands - Step-by-Step Guide for Novices
This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for completing Assignment 1. It includes where to place files, how to enter credentials, and breadcrumb paths for navigation in tools like Git Bash or GitHub. Assume you're using Windows; adjust paths if on another OS. All commands are executed in Git Bash (or Command Prompt/PowerShell for some).
Prerequisites

Download and install Git from git-scm.com (during installation, select "Git Bash Here" for context menu).
Create a GitHub account at github.com if you don't have one.

Step 1: Install Git Bash

Go to git-scm.com/downloads.
Download the Windows installer.
Run the installer.
Follow the wizard: Accept defaults, but ensure "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" is selected.
Finish installation.
Verify: Open Git Bash (search for "Git Bash" in Start menu), type git --version, and press Enter. It should show the version.

Step 2: Perform Git Commands Using Git Bash
Open Git Bash. Create a project directory for practice (e.g., for a simple text file).

Create a directory: mkdir my-git-project (creates folder "my-git-project").
Navigate to it: cd my-git-project.
git init: Type git init and press Enter. This initializes a Git repository (creates .git folder in current directory).
git status: Type git status. Shows the repository status (e.g., no commits yet).
Create a file: Type touch readme.txt (creates an empty file).
git add: Type git add readme.txt (stages the file). Or git add . to stage all.
git commit: Type git commit -m "Initial commit" (commits staged changes with message).
git log: Type git log (shows commit history).
git config: Type git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com" (sets user info for commits).
Edit readme.txt (use echo "Hello" >> readme.txt to add text).
git diff: Type git diff (shows changes since last commit).
git rm: Type git rm readme.txt (removes and stages deletion). Commit after.
ls: Type ls (lists files in directory).
git checkout: Create a branch first (see below), then git checkout main to switch back.
git reset: Type git reset --hard HEAD~1 (reverts to previous commit; careful, discards changes).
git branch: Type git branch (lists branches). git branch new-branch to create one.
touch: Type touch newfile.txt (creates file).
git merge: Switch to new-branch (git checkout new-branch), make changes, commit, switch back (git checkout main), then git merge new-branch.
git rebase: Similar to merge, but git rebase main from new-branch for linear history.

Step 3: Perform GitHub Commands

Create a repository on GitHub:
Log in to github.com.
Breadcrumb path: Click "+" icon (top-right) > New repository.
Enter name (e.g., "my-git-project"), make public, add README if wanted, click "Create repository".


Link local repo to GitHub: In Git Bash, type git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-git-project.git.
git clone: To clone, type git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-git-project.git in a new directory.
git push: Make changes, add/commit, then git push origin main (pushes to GitHub). Enter username/password or use SSH/token for auth.
git pull: Type git pull origin main (fetches and merges from GitHub).

Where to Put Files/Credentials

Files: In your project folder (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\my-git-project).
Credentials: For GitHub, use personal access token (PAT): Go to github.com > Settings (profile icon > Settings) > Developer settings (left menu) > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token. Copy and use as password in push/pull.
.git folder: Automatically created in project root; don't modify manually.

Conclusion
Follow these steps in order. Practice in a test folder to avoid mistakes.
